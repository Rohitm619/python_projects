<h1>Two Sums</h1>

Given an array of integers **'nums'** and *n* integer **'target'**,
return *indices* of the two numbers such that they add up to **'target'**

you may assume that each input has *exacly one solution*, and you may
not use the same element *twice*
<br>
'''
Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target =9
Output: [0,1]
Output: Because nums[0] + nums[1] = 9
