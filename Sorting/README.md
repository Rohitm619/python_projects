# Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains various sorting algorithms used in programming for sorting and arranging data.
Understanding and learning to implement these algo's is an important skill to have for a programmer.

All these sorting algorithm are written in such a way that they are east to 
grasp and understand for a beginner level programmer

<br>
<b>Insertion Sort</b> is a simple sorting algorithm that works similar to the way you sort playing cards in your hands.</summary>
<br>The array is virtually split into a sorted and an unsorted part. Values from the unsorted part are picked and placed at the correct position in the sorted part.
Algorithm

To sort an array of size n in ascending order:

1: Iterate from arr[1] to arr[n] over the array.
2: Compare the current element (key) to its predecessor.
3: If the key element is smaller than its predecessor, compare it to the elements before. Move the greater elements one position up to make space for the swapped element.
